## Who am I ? 👨‍💻

👨‍🎓 I am currently **Systems and Network Administrator** in sandwich courses at **SDIS76** (firefighters of Seine-Maritime).

💼 After obtaining a **Higher National Diploma** [IT Maintenance and Support Manager](https://www.cesi.fr/formation/gestionnaire-en-maintenance-et-support-informatique-en-alternance) and following some professional experiences [(detailed on LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxencedubois/), I decided in 2021 to resume my studies in order to progress in my professional career.

🎓 So, I obtained a **Bachelor's degree** [Systems and Network Engineering Manager](https://www.cesi.fr/formation/bachelor-administrateur-trice-systemes-et-reseaux-en-alternance) in October 2022, and I continued my study program with a **Master’s degree** [IT Infrastructure and Cybersecurity Manager](https://www.cesi.fr/formation/manager-en-infrastructures-et-cybersecurite-des-si-en-alternance) which will end in September 2024.

💻 My daily missions are to carry out the deployment, maintenance and renewal of firewalls, switches and servers, and to participate in the realization of many projects in order to best secure the information system.
